# Discord-to-Spreadsheet-BOT
BOT for Discord that takes information from Discord and fills a spreadsheet

HOW THE BOT WORKS: You must type 'ns' (lowercase) before any post that you want to add the the spreadsheet. After typing 'ns' (without the quotes) fill the rest in with the following format: 

name, category, short description, link

it should look like this:

ns Ethereum, Platform, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by adoption, https://ethereum.org/

IMPORTANT NOTES: as of right now, the BOT is fussy, so the format has to be exactly correct for your resource to be added. You MUST include: spaces after commas AND 4 items in the correct order.
